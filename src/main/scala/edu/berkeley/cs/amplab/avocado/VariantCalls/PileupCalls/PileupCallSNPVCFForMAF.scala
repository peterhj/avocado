/**
 * Class to call SNPs. Implements the SNP genotyping methods described in:

 * Li, Heng. "A statistical framework for SNP calling, mutation discovery, association mapping and population
 * genetical parameter estimation from sequencing data." Bioinformatics 27.21 (2011): 2987-2993.
 *
 * for a single sample. As we are taking in a single sample, we do not calculate a minor allele frequency (MAF); rather,
 * we assume a MAF of 1 in 10. We only call the genotype if the likelihood has a phred score greater than or equal to 30.
 * At the current point in time, we assume that we are running on a diploid organism.
